- 👋 Hi, I’m @c-al3x
- 👀 I’m interested in libre/open-source software, operating systems development, GNU/Linux, firmware, embedded systems, cybersecurity, networking, and full-stack web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript run-time environments/frameworks (Node.js and React), relational and non-relational databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and sharpening my Python and Javascript skills.  
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on FOSS projects that are Linux, web, and/or music related.
